## Outline / Notes

We can use this [lab](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/swift-vehicle) for inspiration. We can trim it down a bit. We can even *NOT* use it if you think there's a better route we can take. Or even a simpler route.

I've included the .xcworkspace file with all the test stuff.
